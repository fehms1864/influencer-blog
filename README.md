## About This Project 
This project is aimed for influencers to post their thoughts and keep an online blog in order to keep a record of it as well as have subscribed users the access to log in and view the blogs

## Tech Stack
TBD

## Development 
We are a team of 3 developers working on creating a fully functional blog site that targets the following functionality and features:
- a live, responsive and secure https site
- a login authentication page
- a main blog home page

All developers will be contributing to this project using the following convention:
- create a personal branch off of "dev-branch" which is the main development branch
- make code changes in your personal branch and make sure it is in working state
- git push changes up to your remote personal branch
- inform all teammates before merging changes into "dev-branch"
- once "dev-branch" has an important feature completed, then team lead will merge code from "dev-branch" into "main"

The goal is to always have customer ready code in main from which the site will operate.
